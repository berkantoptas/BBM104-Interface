Hacettepe University Computer Engineering BBM104 - Fourth Assignment

#2. Software Using Documentation
##2.1. Software Usage
Program starts “Main.java” class. The input file is given as an argument. input.txt file is the our argument file.(args[0]=input.txt)
##2.2. Error Messages
Program doesn’t have any error messages. Because advisors said that not give wrong input.
#3.Software Design Notes
##3.1. Desctiption of the program
###3.1.1. Problem
In this experiment, I am expected to develop a dedicated Agenda application, like Google Calendar or other popular calendar applications. Agenda system consist of users, professional meetings, personal or professional appointments, resting time activities such as attending events or courses. There will be saving, arranging, attending, cancelling and listing commands in the Agenda system.
##3.2. System Chart
Input : input.txt
Programs : Main.java
App.java
Anniversary.java
Birthday.java
Meeting.java
Appointment.java
Event.java
Concert.java
Theater.java
Sport.java
Course.java
User.java
NotFoundException.java
DuplicatedIDException.java
Output : output.txt
##3.3. Algorithm
1. Program takes 1 argument (args[0]=input.txt)
2. Call runApp function with argument.
2.1. By calling runApp function input.txt file will read and parse.
2.1.1 Also by calling runApp function there will be create output.txt.
